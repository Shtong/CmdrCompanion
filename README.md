#CmdrCompanion

The ideal Commander Companion!

This piece of software aims at assisting commanders into their exploration of the galaxy. While it is at an extremely early stage of development at the moment, and only provides simple trading tools, it aims at becoming a fully offline tool (with optionnal online capabilities) where commanders can log their activities and make notes about the things they encounter in space. Never forget in which station you've see this rare weapon for sale again!

## Source code and contributions

To compile from source all you need is to install Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop (or any more expensive version). I'm definitely OK to accept contributions to the code, although :

- The code will have to be written in the same style that the rest of the code base
- If you are suggesting a new feature, make sure that it's in line with the direction I want to give to the software. Drop me a line if you want to make sure !
- UI changes will also have to respect the existing visual style of the app
